# College_Examples
This is a few assignments from college from various courses to show what I learned.


CIS355 was my Server-Side web development course, where I learned PHP and how to connect websites to a database as well as user authentication. 
The Individual project I used the Laravel framework and built a simple CRUD application where a user could track their bowling leagues and scores.
The Group project we created something similar, but without any frameworks.

The VB example was one of the more advanced assignments where we had to deal with data structures. The assignment was to create a restaraunt application where the user chose a meal (first structure), then what they want out of that meal (second structure) and the ingredients of each item (third structure).

The Java example is a pretty simple one; it is just a cmd application that walks the user through shopping and checkout of various items.
